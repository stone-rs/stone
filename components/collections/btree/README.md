# Slab-based B-Tree implementation

This crate provides an alternative implementation to the standard `BTreeMap`
and `BTreeSet` data structures based on a slab data-structure. In principle,
this implementation is more flexible and more memory efficient. It is more
flexible by providing an extended set of low-level operations on B-Trees
through the `BTreeExt` trait which can be used to further extend the
functionalities of the `BTreeMap` collection.
In addition, the underlying node allocation scheme is abstracted by a type
parameter that can be instantiated by any data structure implementing
slab-like operations.
By default, the `Slab` type (from the `slab` crate) is used, which means
that every node of the tree are allocated in a contiguous memory region,
reducing the number of allocations needed.
In theory, another type could be used to store the entire B-Tree on the stack.

### Usage

From the user point of view, the collection provided by this crate can be
used just like the standard `BTreeMap` and `BTreeSet` collections.
```rust
use btree::BTreeMap;

// type inference lets us omit an explicit type signature (which
// would be `BTreeMap<&str, &str>` in this example).
let mut movie_reviews = BTreeMap::new();

// review some movies.
movie_reviews.insert("Office Space",       "Deals with real issues in the workplace.");
movie_reviews.insert("Pulp Fiction",       "Masterpiece.");
movie_reviews.insert("The Godfather",      "Very enjoyable.");
movie_reviews.insert("The Blues Brothers", "Eye lyked it a lot.");

// check for a specific one.
if !movie_reviews.contains_key("Les Misérables") {
    println!("We've got {} reviews, but Les Misérables ain't one.",
             movie_reviews.len());
}

// oops, this review has a lot of spelling mistakes, let's delete it.
movie_reviews.remove("The Blues Brothers");

// look up the values associated with some keys.
let to_find = ["Up!", "Office Space"];
for movie in &to_find {
    match movie_reviews.get(movie) {
       Some(review) => println!("{}: {}", movie, review),
       None => println!("{} is unreviewed.", movie)
    }
}

// Look up the value for a key (will panic if the key is not found).
println!("Movie review: {}", movie_reviews["Office Space"]);

// iterate over everything.
for (movie, review) in &movie_reviews {
    println!("{}: \"{}\"", movie, review);
}
```

#### Custom node allocation

One can use `btree_slab::generic::BTreeMap` to
use a custom slab type to handle nodes allocation.

```rust
use slab::Slab;
use btree::generic::BTreeMap;

let mut map: BTreeMap<K, V, Slab<Node<K, V>>> = BTreeMap::new();
```

In this example,
the `Slab<Node<_, _>>` type is a slab-like data structure responsible for the nodes allocation.
It must implement all the traits defining the `cc_traits::Slab` trait alias.

### Extended API & Addressing

In this implementation of B-Trees, each node of a tree is addressed
by the `Address` type.
The extended API, visible through the `BTreeExt` trait,
allows the caller to explore, access and modify the
internal structure of the tree using this addressing system.
This can be used to further extend the functionalities of the `BTreeMap`
collection, for example in the
[`range_tree`]() crate.
